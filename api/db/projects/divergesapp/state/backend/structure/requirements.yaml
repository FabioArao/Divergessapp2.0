  restApi:
    justifyYourAnswer: A REST API is necessary for the core functionality of
      DivergesiApp. It will handle user authentication, course management,
      content upload and retrieval, assignment submission and grading, progress
      tracking, and communication features. The REST API will allow the frontend
      to interact with the backend server, perform CRUD operations on various
      resources (users, courses, assignments, etc.), and retrieve data for
      display in the user interface.

  realtimeWebsockets:
    justifyYourAnswer: Real-time WebSocket functionality is required for certain
      features of DivergesiApp. These include the messaging system for instant
      communication between users, real-time notifications for new assignments,
      graded work, and announcements, and potentially for live updates in the
      progress tracking dashboards. WebSockets will enable push notifications
      and live updates without constant polling, improving the user experience
      and reducing server load.
